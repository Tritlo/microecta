# microlta-generator

`microlta-generator` is the Liquid Tree Automata adapter for the ranked engine
in `microecta-generator`. Building the language is pure. `compile` is the one
imperative boundary: it asks Liquid Fixpoint/Z3 which guarded witnesses are
valid and which pool refinements imply one another, then returns a pure
`Compiled` value.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}

import qualified Data.LTA.Gen.QuickCheck as LTA
import Data.LTA.Guard (isSubtypeOf)
import Data.LTA.Refinement (true, (.==.), (.>=.))

choices = LTA.pool
  [ LTA.refined 0 "non-negative" (value .>=. 0)
  , LTA.refined 1 "one"          (value .==. 1)
  ]

liquidPairs =
  LTA.node "pair" true (\actual expected -> actual `isSubtypeOf` expected) $ LTA.do
    left  <- choices
    right <- choices
    LTA.pure (left, right)
```

The do-block only describes independent children. The root symbol, refinement,
and guard live at `node`, where they belong. A value-dependent child choice is
rejected at compile time; express that relationship with the liquid guard.
The guard function receives symbolic constructor arguments in the same order
as the child generators below it. For guards over nested terms,
`descendant left [1]` selects the second child below `left`. The common cases
read as ``argument `requires` nonZero``, ``actual `isSubtypeOf` expected``, and
`withActualFor actual formal dependentResultCheck`. Raw `Guard` constructors
and `argument` remain available for unusual programmatic guards.

After the one solver phase, QuickCheck and replay are pure:

```haskell
Right compiled <- LTA.compile solver liquidPairs

quickCheck $ LTA.forAll compiled (uncurry (>=))
replayed = LTA.select failingRank compiled
```

The pool need not be part of a long-lived specification. It can be sampled and
frozen only for one generation run:

```haskell
compiled <- LTA.compileSampled solver $ do
  lefts  <- LTA.samplePool 32 nativeRefinedInt
  rights <- LTA.samplePool 8  nativeRefinedInt
  pure $
    LTA.node "pair" true (\actual expected -> actual `isSubtypeOf` expected) $ LTA.do
      left  <- lefts
      right <- rights
      LTA.pure (left, right)
```

Here the two pools are sampled independently. Sample once and use the same
`LTAGen` at both child positions when they should share a universe. The pools
remain fixed inside `compiled`; changing them for each individual test would
make ranks, replay, and shrinking unstable and would also invoke Z3 per test.
Independent pool sizes multiply: the example presents 32 x 8 candidate pairs
to the finite pool compiler before its guards reject any of them. Use an ECTA
grouped join when a relation can be indexed by finite keys; use a smaller or
native-shrunk frozen pool when the relation genuinely needs SMT entailment.

For replay across process runs, fix each pool with a seed, just as in
`microecta-generator`:

```haskell
lefts  = LTA.freeze 20260902 32 nativeRefinedInt
rights = LTA.freeze 20260903 8  nativeRefinedInt
```

The same seed, size, and native generator produce the same pool ranks. Reuse a
single frozen value at several child positions when they should range over one
shared universe; use distinct seeds for independent pools.

## What the LTA adds

An FTA says which constructor shapes exist. An ECTA additionally says that two
paths must contain the same term. An LTA can say that one path's refinement
implies another predicate, including after substituting actual argument names
for formal parameters. That permits constraints such as:

```haskell
safeDivision =
  LTA.node "divide" true
    (\_ denominator -> denominator `requires` nonZero) $ LTA.do
      numerator   <- integers
      denominator <- integers
      LTA.pure (Divide numerator denominator)
```

For dependent application, put the result type, function, and argument in the
term exactly as the paper does, and give names to the nested type positions:

```haskell
applicationGuard result function argument =
  allOf
    [ argument `isSubtypeOf` descendant function [1] -- input type
    , withActualFor argument (descendant function [0]) $
        descendant function [2] `isSubtypeOf` result -- output type
    ]
```

The compiler checks every frozen candidate once, removes those whose complete
guard is false, and returns a pure language. This is semantic pruning at the
finite QuickCheck boundary: invalid values never reach a property.

## Refinement shrinking, similarity, and pools

A refined pool contributes potential local replacements. Compilation asks Z3
whether the current refinement implies each candidate refinement. Strict
implication is a shrink; logically equivalent entries shrink toward the earlier
pool rank to keep the graph acyclic.

The refinement is a trusted annotation on the Haskell value. The generic
library cannot prove that an arbitrary `a` satisfies a Liquid Fixpoint
predicate without an explicit encoding for `a`; a typed frontend could supply
that check later.

Those local replacements are lifted through `node` products. The complete LTA
guard is then decisive: a replacement that makes the whole tree invalid is
never handed to QuickCheck. The compiler follows its shrink edges through that
invalid intermediate and reconnects any valid descendants.

For the example, the raw product is:

```text
(0,0)  accepted
(0,1)  rejected: non-negative does not entail exactly-one
(1,0)  accepted
(1,1)  accepted
```

`(1,1)` therefore shrinks first to `(1,0)` and can reach `(0,0)` without ever
emitting `(0,1)`. `samplePool n native` does the same thing for a finite pool
drawn once from a native QuickCheck generator. Repeated draws remain repeated
ranks, retaining empirical weight, while implication supplies semantic shrink
edges.

`compiledSupport` returns the LTA containing only accepted witnesses. Its
automaton is a specialization of `Data.Tree.FTA`; `Data.Tree.Gen` and
`Data.Tree.Gen.QuickCheck` provide the shared sampling and shrinking machinery.
Weights influence sampling but do not duplicate replay ranks. Transition
refinements are part of the support alphabet, so replay cannot invent a new
annotation for an existing constructor.

Similarity minimisation is separate and opt-in because dropping a syntactically
different value is often the wrong trade-off for testing. Declare the
similarity class when semantic representatives are what you want:

```haskell
Right representatives <-
  LTA.minimizePoolBy solver operationKind candidates
```

Within each class, a strict subtype replaces its supertype, equivalent entries
keep the earlier rank, and incomparable entries remain. This mirrors the LTA
paper's minimisation rule without silently reducing ordinary QuickCheck
coverage.

## Recursive LTAs

The core accepts recursive LTAs as long as guards do not point into cyclic
states. QuickCheck still needs a finite run, so unfold with an explicit
constructor-depth bound and then compile normally:

```haskell
Right bounded  = LTA.fromAutomatonUpToDepth 6 recursiveLTA
Right compiled <- LTA.compile solver bounded
```

Depth zero keeps nullary transitions; every recursive constructor consumes one
unit. Ranks remain deterministic inside the bounded language.

The compiler discovers every implication relation inside a pool, which is
quadratic in the number of distinct pool refinements. That is useful for small
semantic universes. A production version should let a native value shrinker
propose a sparse candidate graph for large sampled pools, with Z3 validating
only those edges.

Enter the repository's `nix-shell` to place Z3 on `PATH`, then run the complete
example:

```sh
cabal run liquid-pairs
```
